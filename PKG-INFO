### 4. How to use

While server is installed and running, you can have access as an http connection on port 9000.
odoo default log folder and log file name are embedded as default value. So, you will receive logs immediately.

Each time you refresh your server page on ```http://<your_server_address>:9000```, you will receive the last 10 records
of the log file. After that, it will fetch all new log records, every second.

This package is simulating pycharm run view. This way, it always keeps the scroll the page on bottom automatically.

If you scroll up a little, the reading process would be stopped. It means that you would not be intrupted by data refresh 
while you are reading some lines.

Besides, on the page header, there is a checkbox which you make you able to stop the auto fetch process.
